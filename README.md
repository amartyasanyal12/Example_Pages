# My Portfolio
Hi, This is Amartya Sanyal. I am an economics graduate currently working at Amazon. These are my projects which have been fostered by an interest in Data Science and is a favorite past-time now. Some projects are still in progress and are continuously updated. Hope you like it!!!

## PERFORMANCE OF BANKS IN INDIA: Analysis Based On POS-ATM Transactions(2018-2019)
This project was completed during an internship with **HDFC Bank**, wherein the first part of the project required an overview of the performance of banks in terms of ATM-POS transactions in India. The data was scraped from Reserve bank Of India website; the following years were chosen (2018-2019). The focus area for the project was to understand how HDFC Bank could improve itâ€™s Point of Sales (POS) Machine customer retention and also their performance in comparison to private and government banks in India. There are two parts to this project in python: **Data visualization and Main project report.**
* Engineered features from the dataset to extract per customer purchasing amount for each bank. Segregated the banks based on ownership type and categorized each bank on the basis of their performance.
* The purpose of this EDA is to find insights which will serve us later in another notebook for Data cleaning/preparation/transformation which will ultimately be used into a machine learning algorithm
* Python libraries: Pandas (data frame handling, imputation, plotting), seaborn, scikit learn, matplotlib
* Feature engineering, feature scaling, binning data 
* Visual exploration: Univariate, bi-variate and multi-variate visualization

## SOCCER PERFORMANCE ANALYTICS(EPL DATASET 2009-2010)
* Scraped data from various websites using python and selenium-JSON and API files/databases
* Engineered features from the given database to find out the best perfoming teams in the division based on conversion rate,xG,xA
* Optimized Linear Regression by composite scoring to get the best model. 
* In depth Visual analysis of teams performance in that season
